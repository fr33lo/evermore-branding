# Evermore Brand and Loader Guidelines

This is a quick introduction to the ideas and concepts that I came up with while making the branding guidelines for this project as well as an explanation for the developer to implement my ideas into the loader.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do
* Do use our logo in promotion material

* Do follow the color guidelines

* Do use both the full and normal logos against darker backgrounds

### Don't

* Don't use our logo in everyday conversation unless through emoticons

* Don't use random colors with our logo or backgrounds

* Don't use our logo and full logo against white backgrounds unless text is turned darker shades
## Implement Graphics

The easiest way to implement these graphics is to use the **PDF in the folder**  as well as the **.fig (Figma needed to open it)** that gives you the exact dimensions, font size, font weight, etc. for you to perfect the loader. and figure out where everything goes and make it all symmetrical.  The font that I used for the loader is all variations of **HK Grotesk**.

 Make sure that all the fields are clickable and that there is correct protections of passwords with bullet points. For transparent images such as **headers** and **buttons** make sure that you use the included images. For the avatar in the welcome screen make sure that you put an image fill based on whatever their profile picture is on Discord.
